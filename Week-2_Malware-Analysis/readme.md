##  Analysis Methodology & Tools Used

### 1.  Static Analysis
- **VirusTotal** ‚Äì OSINT and certificate revocation detection.
- **Kali Tools (file, md5sum, objdump)** ‚Äì File identity and import analysis.
- **PEStudio & Ghidra** ‚Äì Decompiled code analysis, C2 extraction, obfuscation detection.

### 2.  Dynamic Analysis
- **Any.Run Sandbox** ‚Äì Execution monitoring and process tree analysis.
- **Wireshark** ‚Äì Network packet inspection of C2 beaconing.
- **Registry and Process Monitoring** ‚Äì Tracked persistence and self-deletion routines.

##  Observed Behavior Flow (Attack Chain)

1. **Establish Persistence**  
   Writes itself to `RunOnce` registry key to run after reboot.

2. **Contact C2 Server**  
   Performs DNS lookup and sends beacon to `g.azmagis.ru`.

3. **Receive Commands**  
   Gets an HTTP 200 OK with instructions for the next stage.

4. **Cover Tracks**  
   Launches `cmd.exe` to run `taskkill.exe` and `ping.exe` before deleting itself.

##  Conclusion

Trojan.Win32.RuKometa is a **first-stage dropper** that facilitates **long-term access** and **remote command execution**.  
Its strength lies in stealth and persistence, enabling threat actors to **deploy additional payloads** post-infection.  
Key highlights include usage of a **fraudulent certificate**, **obfuscated strings**, and **‚ÄúLiving off the Land‚Äù binaries**, making detection and analysis more difficult.
